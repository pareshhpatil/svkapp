                the Receiver and request that the Receiver (i) provide information so that we 

                may validate the identity of the Receiver at the Site and then (ii) provide Eligible 

                Transaction Account information in order to complete the Payment Instruction

                transferred into the Receiver's Eligible Transaction Account no earlier than the 

                next 3 Business Day after you initiated the Payment Instruction subject to receipt 

                of proper funds into Nodal from the sender eligible account. If you request a one-

                time Payment<br />

                Instruction to be initiated on a specified date or a recurring series of Payment

                Instruction to be initiated on specified dates, then the processing of the Payment

                Instruction will begin on the specified date(s) and the debiting of your Eligible

                Transaction Account will occur as early as the specified date(s). However, the 

                payment funds will be transferred into the Receiver Eligible Transaction Account 

                no earlier than the next three (3) Business Day following the specified date. The 

                Site may contain additional information regarding the delivery of a payment to 

                an Eligible Transaction Account and the same would be updated from time to 

                time. Users agree to read and adhere to the same.<br />

                back to the sender. You further acknowledge and agree that our receipt of money 

                to be transmitted to a Receiver shall not be deemed to have occurred and our 

                obligation to complete a transaction shall not begin until such time as the 

                Receiver provides us with (or we otherwiseobtain) all required information 

                necessary to process the related Payment Instruction in accordance with this 

                Agreement. Any cancellation of a Payment Instruction prior to the Receiver

                Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments provisions as per 

                below.<br /><br />

                <b>Receiving Payments</b><br />

                If you want to initiate a Payment Instruction (in response to a Swipez Request

                or otherwise) using the Service to an Eligible Transaction Account you hold or,

                if you as a Requestor want to initiate a Swipez Request, he, she or you can do

                that from an Eligible Transaction Account at a financial institution that 

                participates in the Swipez service or at the Site.<br />

                You understand and agree that there may be a delay between the time you are 

                notified of the pending Payment Instruction and the deposit of the payment 

                funds into your Eligible Transaction Account, and you may be required to take 

                additional steps to facilitate the deposit of the payment of funds into your 

                Eligible Transaction Account.<br />

                You authorize the Sender, the financial institution which holds the Sender's 

                Eligible Transaction Account and us (including through the Site) to send emails 

                to you and text messages to your mobile phone in connection with the Sender's 

                initiation of Payment Instructions to you, and, as a Receiver, you may also 

                receive Swipez Requests from others through the Service.<br />

                You acknowledge and agree that in the event that funds are transferred into your

                Eligible Transaction Account as a result of a Payment Instruction and it is 

                determined that such transfer was improper because it was not authorized by 

                the sender, because there were not sufficient funds in the sender's account, or 

                for any other reason, then you hereby authorize us to withdraw from your 

                Eligible Transaction Account an amount equal to the amount of funds improperly 

                transferred to you.<br />

                If you as a Requestor initiate a Swipez Request using the Service you 

                acknowledge and agree that as disclosed on the Site, (a) the applicable service 

                fee may be deducted from payments received by you from a Sender(s). You 

                acknowledge and agree that individuals to whom you send a Swipez Request 

                may not receive, or otherwise may reject or ignore, yourSwipez Request. We do 

                not guarantee that you will receive any payments from

                individuals by initiating a Swipez Request.<br /><br />

                <b>Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments</b>

                Sender may cancel the initiation of a Payment Instruction or stop a Payment 

                Instruction at any time until the processing of the Payment Instruction into the 

                Receiver Eligible Transaction Account has begun. Our ability to stop a Payment 

                Instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment 

                Instruction will depend on the manner in which the Payment Instruction was 

                initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction to the Receiver Eligible 

                Transaction Account has begun processing.<br />

                Although we will make a reasonable effort to accommodate a stop payment 

                request and to recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment 

                Instruction, we will have no liability for failing to do so. We may also require you 

                to present your stop payment request or request to recover funds in writing 

                within three (3) days after contacting us. The charge for each stop payment or 

                fund recovery request will be the current charge for such stop payment or funds 

                recovery service as set out in the applicable fee schedule or as disclosed through 

                the Site. Payments not claimed by a Receiver will be automatically cancelled 

                three (3) days after the processing of the payment begins. When a Sender 

                initiates a Payment Instruction, the Receiver is not required to accept the 

                payment. You agree that you as a Sender will not hold us liable for any damages 

                resulting from a Receiver decision to accept or not to accept a payment initiated 

                or attempted through the Service. We will, to the extent permitted by law, make 

                reasonable attempts to return any unclaimed, refused,

                refunded, prohibited, or denied payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or

                use other reasonable efforts to return such payment to you as permitted by law.<br /><br />

                <b>Refused Payments</b><br />

                We reserve the right to refuse to pay any Receiver either on our judgement or at

                the behest of the bank/Issuer/financial institution/sender. We will attempt to 

                notify the Sender promptly if we decide to refuse to pay a Receiver designated by 

                the Sender. This notification is not required if you attempt to make a prohibited 

                payment under this Agreement.<br /><br />

                <b>Returned Payments</b><br />

                In using the Service, you understand that Receivers may reject payments or 

                otherwise return payment. In such event the funds, if received in the Nodal bank 

                shall be remitted back to sender within 3 business days post clear receipt of 

                funds and proper reconciliation. OPUS NET PVT.LTD reserves the right to levy 

                any additional fee or charge in case of such returned payments.<br /><br />
