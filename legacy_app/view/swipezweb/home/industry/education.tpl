                        For any professionally run educational institute to function efficiently it needs to
                        collect its fees on time and have the ability to monetize its facilities.
                        Running billing across the complete student database and managing fee
                        collections can be a time consuming and error-prone process. Especially now, when fee
                        collections need to be provided in multiple different modes online while supporting
                        traditional offline modes like cash, cheque & NEFT transfers. Another key challenge
                        for institutes that lease out their venues and facilities is managing the time slots
                        and dates for bookings and collecting payments for these bookings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">Streamline your billing and collections irrespective of the size of your
                        student base. Send invoices over email and SMS to kick start your payment collections
                        online. Get paid faster, avoid delays and loss of revenue due to cash collection and cheque
                        bounces. Using the subscription manager setup recurring billing, cutting time and effort for
                        future billing. Reconcile all your incoming payments online and offline and maintain a
                        single legder of collections at all times. Use our extensive reports to get insights into
                        late payments, student/parent data and fee collections at your finger tips. Prepare GST ready
                        data and file your GST to the GST portal within minutes.</p>
