                    <p class="lead">Increasingly peoples lives are only getting busier. As an administrator of health or
                        sport venues, providing available time slots on the fly to your clients is tough. Your clients
                        want to book time slots via phone, WhatsApp or SMS. For sports venues that have limited
                        facilities, efficient automated booking is crucial to optimize revenue generation and customer
                        satisfaction. Along with bookingâ€™s ensuring that facility bookings if cancelled are reutilized
                        also plays a crucial role in streamlining revenue. Post booking tracking utilization of
                        facilities is also a key component for venue management. Sports venues also require the ability
                        to customize their time slots allowing for special instructor led courses.</p>
                    <p class="lead">With our venue booking software sports venues can organize their facility
                        bookings and reduce the burden on facility staff. By creating an online booking calendar of all
                        the facilities offered customers can book time slots as per their convenience. Post booking the
                        customer or staff management can manage bookings, cancellations and re-bookings online. A QR
                        based booking confirmation assists with entry at the venue and helps you track usage at the same
                        time stop unauthorized usage of your facilities. For special instructor led events you can setup
                        separate calendars and notify the necessary staff once a booking is made thereby making it a
                        flawless process for customers, organizers and instructors. Streamline your facility
                        administration and realize the full revenue potential of your venue.
