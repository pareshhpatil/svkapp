                    <p class="lead">Hosting events for your establishment is a complex and time consuming affair that
                        requires meticulous planning. Right from setting up an online events page, setting up different
                        packages as per your offering, to getting registrations from attendees the list just keeps on
                        going. Collecting payments online in advance helps in minimizing the impact of no-shows in the
                        preparation leading up to your event. On the day of your event along with execution you also
                        have to provide access to your customers as per their packages which can become cumbersome,
                        making you and your team look unprepared. Setting up an all encompassing solution for all these
                        processes is key to running an event smoothly.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Using our events platform you can simplify the process of event registrations and
                        booking saving yourself a lot of time and effort. You can create a beautiful online booking
                        ready event landing pages with a few clicks of the mouse, all in your control. Collect payments
                        in advance online via modes like UPI, wallets, credit, debit cards or net banking with the
                        lowest transaction rates in the industry. With no revenue share on tickets sold you earn more
                        from your own event. After booking your customers will receive their QR enabled tickets through
                        email which can be scanned on the day of the event creating a systematic entry system. Once
                        you've held a successful event all customer data is stored in your Swipez login. You can use
                        this customer database for future events and promote your events using our SMS promotions
                        feature. All this and more to help you prepare the foundation for the next level of client
                        experience.
