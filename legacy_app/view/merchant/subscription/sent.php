         Your request for payment has been sent to your customers.  You will receive a notification from us when the patron pays by clicking on the Swipez request link.

We have a few options for notifications. You can customize them by visiting the Setting section in your profile. <br />
<br />



A notification is sent out each time a patron settles a payment. The amount will be credited to your account in 2-3 working days upon payment by the patron.
