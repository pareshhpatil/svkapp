  <p>
  Lane discipline is vital for maintaining order on the roads. Stick to your designated lane and avoid unnecessary lane changes. Overtake from the right side of the vehicle ahead only when it is safe to do so.

  <h3>4. Wear Seat Belts</h3>
  <p>
  The use of seat belts is mandatory for all occupants of a vehicle. Ensure that everyone is buckled up before starting the journey. Seat belts significantly reduce the risk of injury during accidents.

  <h3>5. Stop at Red Signals</h3>
  <p>
  When approaching a red traffic signal, it is mandatory to stop behind the white stop line or the signal itself. Wait for the green signal before proceeding further, even if there is no traffic coming from other directions.

  <h3>6. Give Way to Emergency Vehicles</h3>
  <p>
  When you hear the siren or see the flashing lights of an emergency vehicle, immediately give way and make space for them to pass. This allows emergency services to reach their destinations promptly.  </p>

  <h3>7. No Drunk Driving</h3>
  <p>
  Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is a serious offense. It impairs your judgment and reaction time, increasing the risk of accidents. Never drink and drive, and always designate a sober driver or use alternative transportation.  <figure>

  <h3>8. Follow Pedestrian Crossings</h3>
  <p>
  Pedestrians have the right of way at designated crosswalks. Slow down or stop to let them cross safely. Always be cautious, especially near schools, hospitals, and crowded areas.
