                <h2 class="display-5 mb-4 text-left">Why Should You Use A PDF Format For An Invoice?</h2>
                <p class="lead text-left">The PDF format was created to allow people to open and study documents without having to purchase the software that the documents were created with. Adobe Acrobat Reader, a free programme, is all you need to open or convert a PDF file.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">Documents can be presented in PDF format in the same way they were intended to be seen - with the original fonts, spacing, photos, and graphic design. When you convert a document to PDF, all of the formatting is preserved.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">It's also a trusted format since, though a PDF can be edited, it can't be done without leaving electronic evidence of the change.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">Apart from that PDF files are…
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Easy To Convert</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    Converting a document to a PDF usually takes only a few seconds.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Size Friendly</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    A PDF is a graphic representation of the original document. This means your file will be smaller, which will make it easier to open and email.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Hand In Glove With Hyperlinks</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    On PDFs, hyperlinks work flawlessly. If your invoice includes your email address, the recipient can send you an email by simply clicking on the link.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Password Protected</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    You can enable the password function on a PDF if you want to beef up security. This implies that no one can open the document unless you first give them the password. This is a particularly useful feature for a company that has a lot of confidential papers, such as financial accounts, that it needs to communicate with a small group of people.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Editable</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    In the same way that recipients can make comments, highlight, or mark-up portions on a Word document, recipients can do the same with a PDF and submit it back to you for review.

                <p class="lead text-left">
                    In your invoice template, include your name, address, additional contact information, and business information. If you have a query, it's easy for your customer to talk to you.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Invoice Date and Due Date</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    This offers your customer a time limit on when they must pay you. Other information includes the date it was sent, the payment deadline, and so on.

                <h4 class="text-left">Transaction Details</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    Your invoice template should include information such as the price of each product or service offered any taxes, and other data that support the particular amount for each item. This allows the customer to see exactly what they're paying for.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Terms and Conditions</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    Whether you've agreed to a monthly or biweekly payment schedule, your invoice template must include your terms and conditions to avoid any communication breakdowns that could result in late payments or missed deadlines.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left"> The simpler your payment terms and conditions are, the easier they will be for your consumer to understand and, as a result, the payment will be made faster.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Invoice Number</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    It's critical that you know how many invoices have been sent out, which payments have been received, and which are still owed to you. To avoid any confusion, give each invoice a distinct invoice number in your invoice template.

                <p class="lead text-left">
                    You've finished working on your client's project or shipped your goods and now twiddling your thumbs waiting for the payment from your client. Perhaps you and the client neglected to negotiate payment terms before the start of the project, and now it’s up to you to present them with a payment invoice.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">Sounds familiar?
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">Every business owner must have a proper, professional method of billing their customers, reminding them of the amount due, the purpose of payments, and the date the services are provided.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">Professional invoice template is a must for the growth of your company because they ensure that you are paid on time and for what your product/services are worth.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">Whether you’ve decided on a bi-weekly, pre-payment or for the payment after the project is completed, to turn the odds in your favour, the best time is to send an invoice in the morning before they start work. That’s the time your client is more likely to check their email and set a checklist for the day.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">Always be prepared to send your client an invoice irrespective if they ask for it.

                <p class="lead text-left">That is why, use Swipez to build a strong professional relationship with your clients, save time and get paid quickly
