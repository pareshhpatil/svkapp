                <p class="lead text-left">After downloading the invoice template from Swipez, follow these steps:
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">You can generate an invoice from scratch in Word, but using one of Word's available templates is the simplest option. After you've decided on a template, simply save it to your computer and fill in the blanks. You don't need a Microsoft Office subscription to utilise Word's online invoice creator, but you will need one to amend invoices online.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">It's time to create your invoice after you've found a few basic invoice designs you'd want to attempt. You can download the invoice template to your computer once again and alter it there. Alternatively, you can complete the entire process using Microsoft Word:
                <ul class="text-left">
                    <li> Open Microsoft Word.</li>
                    <li> Select New from the File menu.</li>
                    <li> Type in invoice in the search, and Word will display all available invoice templates.</li>
                    <li> Select the template you'd like to use and open it</li>
                    <li> Fill in the details</li>
                    <li> Save it in your preferred format </li>

                <p class="lead text-left">
                    Every time you create an invoice for clients, you should include these necessary details in your invoice template.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Invoice date and Invoice due date</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    This gives your customer a deadline for how long they have to pay you. Other details include the date it was sent, due date for payment etc.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Name and Address</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    Include your name, address, other contact details and details of your business in your invoice template. This makes it easy for your customer to communicate with you if they have a query.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Terms</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    Whether you have agreed on monthly or a bi weekly payment schedule, your invoice template has to include your terms and conditions to avoid any communication issues which can lead to outstanding payments, or missed due dates.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-left">The shorter the payment terms and conditions, the easier it will be for your customer to understand and thus quicker the payment.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">What Are You Charging Them For?</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    Details like the price of each product or service offered, applicable tax and other details justifying the individual amount for each item should be included in your invoice template. This helps the customer to get a clear picture of what they are paying for.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Invoice Number</h4>
                <p class="lead text-left">
                    This is important for you to understand how many invoices have been issued, which payments have been cleared, which are due etc. Include a unique invoice number in your invoice template for each invoice to avoid any confusion.
